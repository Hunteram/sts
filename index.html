<!-- The images need to be prepared according to the following method.
In order to get them to be in a portrait orientation:
1. Open image, rotate 90 degrees clockwise and 'make a copy'.
2. This should result in it 'saving' before making a copy. Choose a new name to save as. Note
that the image size should have reduced (around 50% of original size) after saving/ making a copy.
3. Now, rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise and make a copy again. This time, overwrite the original file.
4. The file size should remain the same. Upload this 'original'.
5. For it to be correct, the photo should also appear in the portrait orientation on GitHub 
without having to choose 'raw'.

NB: This is the lazy workaround. The proper technique is to manipulate the EXIF data field of the image.
EXIF communicates information about the orientation of the photo when captured, i.e. from phone or camera.
There is software online that aims to manipulate EXIF. -->
